# Lonca Task

## Usage

After you clone and run the backend project, you can run the frontend project with the commands below:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
yarn start
```

## Notes

- To populate the db with given json files, I have used mongodb-compass gui tool. (There is also another tool called mongoimport that can be used in the command line)
- Unfortunately I did not have much time on responsiveness. There is also an issue with the sorting of the dates in the first line chart (0 padding related sort issue)

## Tech stack

- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongodb (also using mongoose)
